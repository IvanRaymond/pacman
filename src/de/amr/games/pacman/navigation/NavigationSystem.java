	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * <cite> The unique feature of Clyde’s targeting is that it has two separate modes which he
	 * constantly switches back and forth between, based on his proximity to Pac-Man. Whenever Clyde
	 * needs to determine his target tile, he first calculates his distance from Pac-Man. If he is
	 * farther than eight tiles away, his targeting is identical to Blinky’s, using Pac-Man’s current
	 * tile as his target. However, as soon as his distance to Pac-Man becomes less than eight tiles,
	 * Clyde’s target is set to the same tile as his fixed one in Scatter mode, just outside the
	 * bottom-left corner of the maze.</cite>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <cite> The combination of these two methods has the overall effect of Clyde alternating between
	 * coming directly towards Pac-Man, and then changing his mind and heading back to his corner
	 * whenever he gets too close. On the diagram above, the X marks on the path represent the points
	 * where Clyde’s mode switches. If Pac-Man somehow managed to remain stationary in that position,
	 * Clyde would indefinitely loop around that T-shaped area. As long as the player is not in the
	 * lower-left corner of the maze, Clyde can be avoided completely by simply ensuring that you do not
	 * block his “escape route” back to his corner. While Pac-Man is within eight tiles of the
	 * lower-left corner, Clyde’s path will end up in exactly the same loop as he would eventually
	 * maintain in Scatter mode. </cite>

	 * "http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior">here</a>.
	 * <p>
	 * <cite> The blue ghost is nicknamed Inky, and remains inside the ghost house for a short time on
	 * the first level, not joining the chase until Pac-Man has managed to consume at least 30 of the
	 * dots. His English personality description is bashful, while in Japanese he is referred to as 気紛れ,
	 * kimagure, or “whimsical”.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <cite>Inky is difficult to predict, because he is the only one of the ghosts that uses a factor
	 * other than Pac-Man’s position/orientation when determining his target tile. Inky actually uses
	 * both Pac-Man’s position/facing as well as Blinky’s (the red ghost’s) position in his calculation.
	 * To locate Inky’s target, we first start by selecting the position two tiles in front of Pac-Man
	 * in his current direction of travel, similar to Pinky’s targeting method. From there, imagine
	 * drawing a vector from Blinky’s position to this tile, and then doubling the length of the vector.
	 * The tile that this new, extended vector ends on will be Inky’s actual target.</cite>
