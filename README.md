# Pac-Man with an emphasis on state machines (in progress)

Pac-Man? Really? How uncool!

For the average school boy in 2018, a retro game like Pac-Man probably seems to be the most boring and uncool thing you can imagine. These cool kids implement their own 3D shooters with real and unreal engines in less than a week, don't they?

Well, some of them maybe really can do that. I can't. But I think that for most young people with an interest in computer programming also a simple (really?) old-school game like Pac-Man can be very instructive. And for me personally, it brings back a lot of memories. My favorite and also the only computer game I played regularly was ["Snack Attack"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivAZkuBbpsM)  on my Apple II compatible computer. On a green monitor, no colors. But what a sound!
   
A game like Pac-Man is interesting for different reasons. First, it isn't as trivial as "Pong" for example. Programming "Pong" is surely a good start. Programming a game loop, updating and drawing paddles, ball movement, collisions with walls and paddles are good stuff for starters. The next step probably are "Breakout" variants with differnt kinds of targets, waves of targets, levels, special balls and so on. 

Pac-Man is then another level. It offers several new challenges. First, the representation of the maze and the correct movement of the characters in the maze is not trivial. Pac-Man is moved through the maze using the keyboard and you can press the key for the intended direction before Pac-Man reaches the position where it can really turn towards that direction. You can spend a lot of time to get this right (or at least almost right).

Another task is the animation and rendering of Pac-Man and the ghosts. You have to deal with sprites and different kinds of animation. Really try to do all this stuff from the ground up instead of using predefined libraries. It's much more fun getting this right by yourself.

If you have these basics gotten right and your actors can move correctly through the maze, you are challenged with making this the "real" game. What are the states of the game? Which events lead you from one state to the other? How to implement the different ghost behaviours? How to coordinate the game play?

This can become a real mess very quickly if you don't have an idea how to do this in a structured way! Maybe you will look for help on YouTube where all those game "tutorials" tell you that you "just" have to put the right code in your entities' "update" method, add a few variables and flags here and there, write a few if- and switch-statements and all will be well and running. Is it really that simple?

Or you will look into the code of others who have implemented Pac-Man, often with impressive results and little code. And you will look into their code, understand some parts but not get the whole picture because they have implemented certain concepts like state machines in their code but not in a way that helps you to understand the complete working of the game. From a practical point this is completely ok, often the underlying concepts somehow melt into the implementation and can only be recognized later if you have an idea what the implementor was trying to do. But often too, the concepts are only realized half-way or abandoned during the implementation to get the thing finally running.

And then you maybe become frustrated and you lose interest. Or you gove it a last try and search the internet again. And you will find articles about using state machines in game in general and also in the Pac-Man game. You will find introductory computer science courses on AI where Pac-Man is used as a test ground for implementing AI agents. This is certainly very interesting but it doesn't help you with your own Pac-Man implementation because these agents are programmed against some predefined Pac-Man framework and cannot be 1:1 used inside your own game. And it doesn't help you with the control of the overall game play too.

Or you will watch all these introductions and tutorials about state machines and the different ways of implementing them. From basic switch-statements to object-oriented "state pattern"-based implementations, function pointers in C, C++, ready-made libraries like [Appcelerate](http://www.appccelerate.com/) and code generating tools, in the end you have to decide for something.

The more low-level implementations of state machines (switches, function pointers) are the most performant ones but as long a you achieve the performance goals for your game (60 frames/updates per second), you can use whatever implementation you like. And if you want to make your code understandable to other people for learning purposes it is certainly not the best way to choose the low-level ones. 

For that reason I decided to start from the ground up (the theoretical base which are Mealy-machines) and build my own state machine implementation. Of course, I could have used something existing like [Stateless4j](https://github.com/oxo42/stateless4j).

Whatever decision you take, the important thing IMHO is that you take a decision and stick to it, do not reinvent the state machine implementation for each use case from scratch! And now you can concentrate on the "real" stuff: 

Which entities in the Pac-Man game are candidates for getting controlled by state machines? You will be surprised how many parts of your program suddenly will look like state machines to you: 

Of course, Pac-Man and the four ghosts, but also the global game control, maybe also the screen selection logic or even simpler entities in your game. It is interesting to look at your program parts through the state machine glasses and find out where an explicit state machine becomes useful in contrast to just using variables, methods and control-flow statements in free-style.

In the implementation of Pac-Man shown here, I decided to implement the global game control as well as the Pac-Man and ghost control by state machines. These controls are sufficiently complex to be modelled/implemented explicitly. The state machine implementation allows (similarly to the mentioned Stateless4j) to define your state machines inside your code in a declarative way. This is achieved by using the "builder pattern". Further, the overhead of embedding client code into the state machine definitions is reduced by the possibility to use lambda expressions (anonymous functions) or function/method references. This allows for a smooth integration of state machines in your program. You have the flexibility to write your code inline inside the state machine hooks (onEntry, onExit, on(event), onTimeout), or to delegate this to separate classes/methods. You can also just use the predefined state objects or if needed define the state objects in separate classes, maybe with additional methods and state. This is for example used in the implementation of the overall game control:

```java
StateMachine.define(PlayState.class, GameEvent.class)
    
    .description("[GameControl]")
    .initialState(READY)
    
    .states()
    
        .state(READY)
            .impl(new ReadyState())
            .timeoutAfter(game::getReadyTime)
        
        .state(PLAYING)
            .impl(new PlayingState())
        
        .state(CHANGING_LEVEL)
            .impl(new ChangingLevelState())
            .timeoutAfter(game::getLevelChangingTime)
        
        .state(GHOST_DYING)
            .impl(new GhostDyingState())
            .timeoutAfter(game::getGhostDyingTime)
        
        .state(PACMAN_DYING)
            .impl(new PacManDyingState())
        
        .state(GAME_OVER)
            .impl(new GameOverState())

    .transitions()
        
        .when(READY).then(PLAYING).onTimeout()
            
        .stay(PLAYING)
            .on(FoodFoundEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onFoodFound(e))
            
        .stay(PLAYING)
            .on(BonusFoundEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onBonusFound(e))
            
        .stay(PLAYING)
            .on(PacManGhostCollisionEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onPacManGhostCollision(e))
            
        .stay(PLAYING)
            .on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onPacManGainsPower(e))
            
        .stay(PLAYING)
            .on(PacManGettingWeakerEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onPacManGettingWeaker(e))
            
        .stay(PLAYING)
            .on(PacManLostPowerEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onPacManLostPower(e))
    
        .when(PLAYING).then(GHOST_DYING)
            .on(GhostKilledEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onGhostKilled(e))
            
        .when(PLAYING).then(PACMAN_DYING)
            .on(PacManKilledEvent.class)
            .act(e -> playingState().onPacManKilled(e))
            
        .when(PLAYING).then(CHANGING_LEVEL)
            .on(LevelCompletedEvent.class)
            
        .when(CHANGING_LEVEL).then(PLAYING)
            .onTimeout()
    
        .stay(GHOST_DYING)
            .on(PacManGettingWeakerEvent.class)
        
        .when(GHOST_DYING).then(PLAYING)
            .onTimeout()
            
        .when(PACMAN_DYING).then(GAME_OVER)
            .on(PacManDiedEvent.class)
            .condition(() -> game.livesRemaining == 0)
            
        .when(PACMAN_DYING).then(PLAYING)
            .on(PacManDiedEvent.class)
            .condition(() -> game.livesRemaining > 0)
            .act(() -> actors.init())
    
        .when(GAME_OVER).then(READY)
            .condition(() -> Keyboard.keyPressedOnce(KeyEvent.VK_SPACE))
                    
.endStateMachine();
```

The states of this state machine are implemented as separate (inner) classes. However, this is not necessary in simpler cases and is the decision of the implementor.

Pac-Man's state machine looks like this:

```java
StateMachine.define(State.class, GameEvent.class)
        
    .description("[Pac-Man]")
    .initialState(SAFE)

    .states()

        .state(SAFE)
            .onEntry(this::initPacMan)
            .timeoutAfter(() -> game.sec(0.25f))

        .state(VULNERABLE)
            .onTick(this::inspectMaze)
            
        .state(STEROIDS)
                .onTick(() -> {	inspectMaze(); checkHealth(); })
                .timeoutAfter(game::getPacManSteroidTime)

        .state(DYING)
                .onEntry(() -> s_current = s_dying)
                .timeoutAfter(() -> game.sec(2))

    .transitions()

            .when(SAFE).then(VULNERABLE).onTimeout()
            
            .when(VULNERABLE).then(DYING).on(PacManKilledEvent.class)

            .when(VULNERABLE).then(STEROIDS).on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)

            .when(STEROIDS).on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class).act(() -> brain.resetTimer())

            .when(STEROIDS).then(VULNERABLE).onTimeout().act(() -> events.publishEvent(new PacManLostPowerEvent()))

            .when(DYING).onTimeout().act(e -> events.publishEvent(new PacManDiedEvent()))

.endStateMachine();
```

The processing of all used state machines can be traced to some logger. If a state machine processes an event and does not find a suitable state transition, a runtime exception is thrown. This is very useful for finding gaps in the state machine definitions because you will get a direct hint what is missing in your control logic. Without explicit state machines your program would probably just misbehave but give no information on the why and where.

```

Other features:
- Entity states and timers can be shown at runtime
- Entity routes can be shown at runtime
- Configurable entity navigation behaviour

Example:

Blinky's navigation behaviour is defined as follows:
```java
Ghost ghost = new Ghost(Ghosts.Blinky, pacMan, game, game.maze.blinkyHome, Top4.E, RED_GHOST);
ghost.setNavigation(Ghost.State.AGGRO, chase(pacMan));
ghost.setNavigation(Ghost.State.AFRAID, flee(pacMan));
ghost.setNavigation(Ghost.State.DEAD, goHome());
ghost.setNavigation(Ghost.State.SAFE, bounce());
```

The individual behaviours are implemented as reusable classes implementing a common interface. Behaviours which need to compute routes in the maze can just call the method **Maze.findPath(Tile source, Tile target)** which runs the A* path finder on the underlying grid graph (which is completely useless for such a maze, but it sounds better than BFS :-).

This is the "chase(victim)" behavior implementation:

```java
/**
 * Chasing a refugee through the maze.
 */
class Chase implements Navigation {

	private final MazeMover<?> victim;

	public Chase(MazeMover<?> victim) {
		this.victim = victim;
	}

	@Override
	public MazeRoute computeRoute(MazeMover<?> chaser) {
		RouteData route = new RouteData();
		if (victim.isOutsideMaze()) {
			route.dir = chaser.getNextDir();
			return route;
		}
		route.path = chaser.maze.findPath(chaser.getTile(), victim.getTile());
		route.dir = chaser.maze.alongPath(route.path).orElse(chaser.getNextDir());
		return route;
	}
}
```

I hope this project fulfils the following goals:
- Provide a readable implementation of the Pac-Man game with code that is fun to read
- Motivate the use of explicit state machines in your code
- Provide a base for exchanging my custom state machines by other libraries
- Provide a reference implementation for your own Pac-Man game

Additional ideas:

It would certainly be useful to decouple the UI and the game model / control logic completely to enable an easy replacement of the UI to get a reusable Pac-Man Java library. Want to give it a try?
