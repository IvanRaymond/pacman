# A (hopefully) comprehensible Pac-Man implementation        

<img src="doc/intro.png"/>

## Pac-Man? Really? How uncool!

For the average school kid in 2018, a retro game like Pac-Man probably seems like the most boring and uncool thing you 
can deal with, but I think that for many younger people with an interest in computer programming also a seemingly simple
 game like Pac-Man can be very instructive. 
 
 My personal interest also stems from the fact that the only computer game I played regularly was 
 ["Snack Attack"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivAZkuBbpsM), then running on my Apple II compatible computer in 1984. 
 On a green monitor, no colors. But what a sound!
  
## The challenge
For a beginner, a game like Pac-Man can be interesting for different reasons. First, it isn't as trivial as for example
"Pong" which surely is a good start: programming a game loop, updating and drawing paddles, ball movement, 
collisions with walls and paddles surely are a challenge for starters. The next step probably could be "Breakout" variants 
with different kinds of targets, waves, levels, special balls and so on.

Pac-Man offers different challenges. First, implementing a good representation of the maze and the correct movement of the characters 
through the maze are not trivial. Pac-Man's movement has to be controlled the keyboard, especially you can press the 
key for the intended direction before Pac-Man actually reaches the position where he can turn to that direction. 

Another task are the animations, timers and the rendering of Pac-Man and the four ghosts. One has to deal with sprites 
and different kinds of animations. It's a good exercise to implement all this from scratch instead of using predefined tools.

If one has mastered these basics and the actors can move correctly through the maze, you are challenged with making 
the "real" game. You have to think about what different phases (states) the game can have, how the actors and 
the user interface behave in these states and which "events" lead from one state to the other (state transitions).

Maybe you should start with a single ghost and implement its behavior: waiting in the ghost house, jumping, 
leaving the house and chasing Pac-Man. Next, what should happen when Pac-Man and a ghost are colliding? 
Which part of your program should coordinate this? Should the code be distributed over the actors or should you have 
some kind of mediator, some central game control? Where should the game rules (points, lives, levels etc.) be implemented? 
Just where you need it or in a central place, a *model* in the sense of the Model-View-Controller pattern?

You may think that this is overengineering for such a simple program. But when reading existing Pac-Man code, very often
you don't enjoy it because the game state is distributed in global variables, timers, flags and the game rules are 
distributed over the actors making it rather difficult to get the complete picture.

Without thinking about all these issues and having an idea how to structure it, your code can quickly become a real mess.
Probably you will get some parts running quickly but when it comes to the interaction between the different actors, 
the game state and the timing, you can easily lose ground. 

## Searching for help

And then you will look for help on the internet. You look at game "tutorials" on YouTube but they just tell you to put the right code in your entities' "update" method, add a few variables and flags here and there, write a few if- and switch-statements and all will be well and running. 

Or you will look into the code of others who have implemented Pac-Man, often with impressive results, for example see [here](https://github.com/leonardo-ono/Java2DPacmanGame) or [here](https://github.com/yichen0831/Pacman_libGdx). (Just found another Pac-Man implementation [here](https://github.com/urossss/Pac-Man) which I find very readable and well organized!).

Looking into the code, you are either overwhelmed or you understand only some parts but do not get the whole picture. Even if concepts like state machines are used in their code, they are not written in a way that helps you to understand the complete working of the game. From a practical point this is completely ok, often the underlying concepts somehow melt into the implementation and can only be recognized later if you have an idea what the implementor was trying to do. But often too, the concepts are only realized half-way or abandoned during the implementation to get the thing finally running.

And then you maybe become totally frustrated and lose interest. Or you give it a last try and search the internet again. And you will find articles about using state machines in games in general and also in the Pac-Man game. You will find introductory computer science courses on AI where Pac-Man is used as a test ground for implementing AI agents. This is certainly very interesting but it doesn't help you with your own Pac-Man implementation because these agents are programmed against some predefined Pac-Man framework and cannot be 1:1 used inside your own game. And it doesn't help you with the control of the overall game play too.

## State machines to the rescue

You will maybe read tutorials about *(finite) state machines* and the different possibilities of implementing them: from basic switch-statements, function pointers (C, C++) to object-oriented "state pattern"-based implementations. There are also ready-to-use libraries like [Appcelerate](http://www.appccelerate.com/), [Stateless4j](https://github.com/oxo42/stateless4j) or [Squirrel](http://hekailiang.github.io/squirrel/). What should you do? 

The low-level implementations using switch-statements or function pointers (if your programming language supports this) are the most performant ones but as long a you achieve the performance goals for your game (60 frames/updates per second) you can use whatever you like. Of course, using  a higher-level implementation should make your code more readable and easier to maintain.

I decided to write my own [state machine implementation](https://github.com/armin-reichert/statemachine), which was a good exercise and really fun because of the availability of lambda expressions and method references.

After you have decided which implementation you want to use for your state machines you can finally focus on the game itself.

Which entities in the Pac-Man game are candidates for getting controlled by state machines?

Of course, Pac-Man and the four ghosts, but also the global game control, maybe also the screen selection logic or even simpler entities in your game. It is interesting to look at your program parts through the state machine glasses and find out where an explicit state machine becomes useful.

In the provided implementation, there are a number of explicit state machines:
- Intro screen controller ([IntroView](PacManGame/src/main/java/de/amr/games/pacman/view/intro/IntroView.java))
- Global game controller ([PacManGameController](PacManGame/src/main/java/de/amr/games/pacman/controller/PacManGameController.java))
- Ghost attack controller ([GhostAttackController](PacManGame/src/main/java/de/amr/games/pacman/controller/GhostAttackController.java))
- Pac-Man controller ([Pac-Man](PacManGame/src/main/java/de/amr/games/pacman/actor/PacMan.java))
- Ghost controller ([Ghost](PacManGame/src/main/java/de/amr/games/pacman/actor/Ghost.java))

All these state machines are "implemented" in a declarative way (*builder pattern*). In essence, you write a single 
large Java expression representing the complete state graph together with node and edge annotations representing actions,
 conditions, event conditions and timers.

Lambda expressions (anonymous functions) and function references allow to embed code directly inside the state machine 
definition. However, if the code becomes more complex it is of course possible to delegate to separate methods or 
classes. Both variants are used here.

## State machines in action

Sounds all well and nice, but how does that look in the real code? 

The **intro screen** shows different animations that have to be coordinated using timers and stop conditions. This
is an obvious candidate for using a state machine. The state machine only uses timers, so we can specify
type *Void* as event type. The states are identified by numbers:

```java
beginStateMachine()
	.description("[Intro]")
	.initialState(0)
	.states()

		.state(0)
			// Scroll logo into view
			.onEntry(() -> { show(logo); logo.startAnimation(); })
			.onExit(() -> logo.stopAnimation())

		.state(1)
			// Show ghosts chasing Pac-Man and vice-versa
			.onEntry(() -> {
				show(chasePacMan, chaseGhosts);
				start(chasePacMan, chaseGhosts);
			})
			.onExit(() -> {
				stop(chasePacMan, chaseGhosts);
				chasePacMan.tf.centerX(width);
			})
			
		.state(2)
			// Show ghost points animation and blinking text
			.timeoutAfter(() -> app().clock.sec(6))
			.onEntry(() -> {
				show(ghostPoints, pressSpace, f11Hint, speedHint[0], speedHint[1], speedHint[2], visitGitHub);
				ghostPoints.startAnimation();
			})
			.onExit(() -> {
				ghostPoints.stopAnimation();
				hide(ghostPoints, pressSpace);
			})
			
		.state(42)
			
	.transitions()
		
		.when(0).then(1)
			.condition(() -> logo.isAnimationCompleted())
		
		.when(1).then(2)
			.condition(() -> chasePacMan.isAnimationCompleted() && chaseGhosts.isAnimationCompleted())
		
		.when(2).then(1)
			.onTimeout()
		
		.when(2).then(42)
			.condition(() -> Keyboard.keyPressedOnce(KeyEvent.VK_SPACE))

.endStateMachine();
```

A more complex state machine is used for defining the **global game control**. It processes game events which
are created during the game play, for example when Pac-Man finds food or meets ghosts. Also the different
game states like changing the level or the dying animations of Pac-Man and the ghosts are controlled by this
state machine. Further, the individual states are implemented by subclasses of the generic state class. This
has the advantage that actions which are state-specific can be realized as methods of the subclass.

```java
beginStateMachine()
	
	.description("[Game]")
	.initialState(INTRO)
	
	.states()
		
		.state(INTRO)
			.onEntry(() -> {
				setScreen(getIntroScreen());
				getTheme().snd_insertCoin().play();
				getTheme().loadMusic();
			})
		
		.state(READY)
			.impl(new ReadyState())
		
		.state(PLAYING)
			.impl(new PlayingState())
		
		.state(CHANGING_LEVEL)
			.impl(new ChangingLevelState())
			.timeoutAfter(game::getLevelChangingTime)
		
		.state(GHOST_DYING)
			.impl(new GhostDyingState())
			.timeoutAfter(game::getGhostDyingTime)
		
		.state(PACMAN_DYING)
			.impl(new PacManDyingState())
		
		.state(GAME_OVER)
			.impl(new GameOverState())
			.timeoutAfter(() -> app().clock.sec(30))

	.transitions()
	
		.when(INTRO).then(READY)
			.condition(() -> getIntroScreen().isComplete())
			.act(() -> setScreen(getPlayScreen()))
		
		.when(READY).then(PLAYING).onTimeout()
			
		.stay(PLAYING)
			.on(FoodFoundEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onFoodFound)
			
		.stay(PLAYING)
			.on(BonusFoundEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onBonusFound)
			
		.stay(PLAYING)
			.on(PacManGhostCollisionEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onPacManGhostCollision)
			
		.stay(PLAYING)
			.on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onPacManGainsPower)
			
		.stay(PLAYING)
			.on(PacManGettingWeakerEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onPacManGettingWeaker)
			
		.stay(PLAYING)
			.on(PacManLostPowerEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onPacManLostPower)
	
		.when(PLAYING).then(GHOST_DYING)
			.on(GhostKilledEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onGhostKilled)
			
		.when(PLAYING).then(PACMAN_DYING)
			.on(PacManKilledEvent.class)
			.act(playingState()::onPacManKilled)
			
		.when(PLAYING).then(CHANGING_LEVEL)
			.on(LevelCompletedEvent.class)
			
		.when(CHANGING_LEVEL).then(PLAYING)
			.onTimeout()
			
		.stay(CHANGING_LEVEL)
			.on(PacManGettingWeakerEvent.class)
	
		.stay(GHOST_DYING)
			.on(PacManGettingWeakerEvent.class)
		
		.when(GHOST_DYING).then(PLAYING)
			.onTimeout()
			
		.when(PACMAN_DYING).then(GAME_OVER)
			.condition(() -> isPacManDead() && game.getLives() == 0)
			
		.when(PACMAN_DYING).then(PLAYING)
			.condition(() -> isPacManDead() && game.getLives() > 0)
			.act(this::resetPlayScreen)
	
		.when(GAME_OVER).then(READY)
			.condition(() -> Keyboard.keyPressedOnce(KeyEvent.VK_SPACE))
			
		.when(GAME_OVER).then(INTRO)
			.onTimeout()
					
.endStateMachine();
```

The states of the game controller are implemented as inner classes inheriting from the generic state class. This offers
the possibility to add fields and methods to the state class, in simpler use cases, the base class is sufficient.

The **ghost attack waves** (scattering, chasing) and their timing are implemented by the following state machine:

```java
public class GhostAttackController extends StateMachine<GhostState, Void> {
...
	public GhostAttackController(PacManGame game) {
		super(GhostState.class);
		this.game = game;
		/*@formatter:off*/
		beginStateMachine()
			.description("[GhostAttackTimer]")
			.initialState(SCATTERING)
		.states()
			.state(SCATTERING)
				.timeoutAfter(this::getScatteringDuration)
			.state(CHASING)
				.timeoutAfter(this::getChasingDuration)
				.onExit(this::nextRound)
		.transitions()
			.when(SCATTERING).then(CHASING).onTimeout()
			.when(CHASING).then(SCATTERING).onTimeout()
		.endStateMachine();
		/*@formatter:on*/
	}
}
```

**Pac-Man** is controlled by the following state machine:

```java
beginStateMachine(PacManState.class, GameEvent.class)
		
	.description("[Pac-Man]")
	.initialState(HOME)

	.states()

		.state(HOME)
			.onEntry(this::initPacMan)
			.timeoutAfter(() -> app().clock.sec(1.5f))

		.state(HUNGRY)
			.impl(new HungryState())
			
		.state(POWER)
			.impl(new PowerState())
			.timeoutAfter(game::getPacManPowerTime)

		.state(DYING)
			.impl(new DyingState())

	.transitions()

		.when(HOME).then(HUNGRY).onTimeout()
		
		.when(HUNGRY).then(DYING)
			.on(PacManKilledEvent.class)

		.when(HUNGRY).then(POWER)
			.on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)

		.stay(POWER)
			.on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)
			.act(fsm::resetTimer)

		.when(POWER).then(HUNGRY)
			.onTimeout()
			.act(() -> getEventManager().publish(new PacManLostPowerEvent()))

		.when(DYING).then(DEAD)
			.onTimeout()

.endStateMachine();
```

The **ghosts** are controlled using the following state machine:

```java
beginStateMachine(GhostState.class, GameEvent.class)
	 
	.description(String.format("[%s]", ghostName))
	.initialState(LOCKED)

	.states()

		.state(LOCKED)
			.timeoutAfter(() -> getGame().getGhostLockedTime(this))
			.onTick(() -> {
				move();	
				sprites.select("s_color_" + getMoveDir());
			})
		
		.state(SCATTERING)
			.onTick(() -> {
				move();	
				sprites.select("s_color_" + getMoveDir()); 
			})
	
		.state(CHASING)
			.onEntry(() -> getTheme().snd_ghost_chase().loop())
			.onExit(() -> getTheme().snd_ghost_chase().stop())
			.onTick(() -> {	
				move();	
				sprites.select("s_color_" + getMoveDir()); 
			})
		
		.state(FRIGHTENED)
			.onEntry(() -> {
				getBehavior().computePath(this); 
			})
			.onTick(() -> {
				move();
				sprites.select(inGhostHouse() ? "s_color_" + getMoveDir() : 
					getGame().getPacMan().isLosingPower() ? "s_flashing" : "s_frightened");
			})
		
		.state(DYING)
			.timeoutAfter(getGame()::getGhostDyingTime)
			.onEntry(() -> {
				sprites.select("s_value" + getGame().getGhostsKilledByEnergizer()); 
				getGame().addGhostKilled();
			})
		
		.state(DEAD)
			.onEntry(() -> {
				getBehavior().computePath(this);
				getTheme().snd_ghost_dead().loop();
			})
			.onTick(() -> {	
				move();
				sprites.select("s_eyes_" + getMoveDir());
			})
			.onExit(() -> {
				if (getGame().getActiveGhosts().filter(ghost -> ghost != this)
						.noneMatch(ghost -> ghost.getState() == DEAD)) {
					getTheme().snd_ghost_dead().stop();
				}
			})
			
	.transitions()

		.when(LOCKED).then(FRIGHTENED)
			.condition(() -> canLeaveGhostHouse() && getGame().getPacMan().hasPower())

		.when(LOCKED).then(SCATTERING)
			.condition(() -> canLeaveGhostHouse() && getNextState() == SCATTERING)
		
		.when(LOCKED).then(CHASING)
			.condition(() -> canLeaveGhostHouse() && getNextState() == CHASING)
		
		.when(CHASING).then(FRIGHTENED).on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)
		.when(CHASING).then(DYING).on(GhostKilledEvent.class)
		.when(CHASING).then(SCATTERING).on(StartScatteringEvent.class)

		.when(SCATTERING).then(FRIGHTENED).on(PacManGainsPowerEvent.class)
		.when(SCATTERING).then(DYING).on(GhostKilledEvent.class)
		.when(SCATTERING).then(CHASING).on(StartChasingEvent.class)
		
		.when(FRIGHTENED).then(CHASING).on(PacManLostPowerEvent.class)
			.condition(() -> getNextState() == CHASING)

		.when(FRIGHTENED).then(SCATTERING).on(PacManLostPowerEvent.class)
			.condition(() -> getNextState() == SCATTERING)
		
		.when(FRIGHTENED).then(DYING).on(GhostKilledEvent.class)
			
		.when(DYING).then(DEAD).onTimeout()
			
		.when(DEAD).then(LOCKED)
			.condition(() -> getTile().equals(getRevivalTile()))
			.act(this::reviveGhost)
		
.endStateMachine();
```

## Tracing

The processing of all used state machines can be traced. If a state machine processes an event and does not 
find a suitable state transition, a runtime exception is thrown by default. This is very useful for finding 
gaps in the state machine definition in the development stage. Afterwards, this behavior can be changed so
that only a message is logged for unhandled events. This avoids the need for specifying "empty" transitions
for any event that has no effect in the current state. The Ghost's state machine makes use of that feature.

## Actor movement ("AI")

The game gets most of its entertainment factor from the diversity of attack behavior of the four ghosts. 
In this implementation, these differences in behavior are not realized by subclassing
but by assigning a different implementation of that behavior ("strategy pattern").

### Pac-Man

Pac-Man's movement is controlled by the keyboard:

```java
int[] STEERING = { VK_UP, VK_RIGHT, VK_DOWN, VK_LEFT };

@Override
public OptionalInt supplyIntendedDir() {
	return NESW.dirs().filter(dir -> keyDown(STEERING[dir])).findFirst();
}
```

### Ghosts
The ghosts behave identically in all of their states except the *chasing* state:

```java
getGhosts().forEach(ghost -> {
	ghost.setBehavior(FRIGHTENED, ghost.flee(pacMan));
	ghost.setBehavior(SCATTERING, ghost.headFor(ghost::getScatteringTarget));
	ghost.setBehavior(DEAD, ghost.headFor(ghost::getRevivalTile));
	ghost.setBehavior(LOCKED, ghost.bounce());
});
```

The *chasing* behavior differs for each ghost as explained below. Using the common *headFor* behavior, the individual chase behaviors like *ambush*, *attackDirectly*, *attackWithPartner* can be implemented very easily.

### Blinky (the red ghost)

Blinky's chasing behavior is to directly attack Pac-Man.

```java
blinky.setBehavior(CHASING, blinky.attackDirectly(pacMan));
```

This is the implementation:

```java
default Behavior<Ghost> attackDirectly(PacMan pacMan) {
	return headFor(pacMan::getTile);
}
```

<img src="doc/blinky.png"/>

### Pinky

Pinky, the *ambusher*, heads for the position 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man's current position (in the original game there is an overflow error leading to a slightly different behavior):

```java
pinky.setBehavior(CHASING, pinky.ambush(pacMan, 4));
```

```java
default Behavior<Ghost> ambush(PacMan pacMan, int numTilesAhead) {
	return headFor(() -> ahead(pacMan, numTilesAhead));
}
```

<img src="doc/pinky.png"/>

### Inky (the turquoise ghost)

Inky heads for a position that depends on blinky's current position and the position two tiles ahead of Pac-Man's current position:

Consider the vector `V` from Blinky's position `B` to the position `P` two tiles ahead of Pac-Man, so `V = (P - B)`. 
Add the doubled vector to Blinky's position: `B + 2 * (P - B) = 2 * P - B` to get Inky's target:

```java
inky.setBehavior(CHASING, inky.attackWith(blinky, pacMan));
```

```java
default Behavior<Ghost> attackWith(Ghost blinky, PacMan pacMan) {
	return headFor(() -> {
		Tile b = blinky.getTile(), p = ahead(pacMan, 2);
		return new Tile(2 * p.col - b.col, 2 * p.row - b.row);
	});
}
```

<img src="doc/inky.png"/>

### Clyde (the orange ghost)

Clyde attacks Pac-Man directly (like Blinky) if his straight line distance from Pac-Man is larger than than 8 tiles. 
If closer, he behaves as in scattering mode:

```java
clyde.setBehavior(CHASING, clyde.attackOrReject(pacMan, 8 * TS));
```

```java
default Behavior<Ghost> attackOrReject(PacMan pacMan, int distance) {
	return headFor(
			() -> euclideanDist(self().tf.getCenter(), pacMan.tf.getCenter()) >= distance 
			? pacMan.getTile()
			: self().getScatteringTarget());
}
```

<img src="doc/clyde.png"/>

The visualization of the attack behaviors can be toggled during the game by pressing the key 'r' ("show routes").

### Scattering

In *scattering* mode, each ghost tries to reach his "scattering target" which is a tile outside of the maze. Because ghosts
cannot reverse direction this results in a cyclic movement around the walls in the corresponding corner of the maze:

```java
ghost.setBehavior(SCATTERING, ghost.headFor(ghost::getScatteringTarget));
```

<img src="doc/scattering.png"/>


## Graph based path finding

For simulating the ghost behavior from the original Pac-Man game, no graph based path finding is needed but the *headFor* 
behavior can be used all over the place. To also give an example how graph based path finding can be used, 
the *frightened* behavior has been implemented differently from the original game: a frightened ghost choses a safe corner
by checking the path to each maze corner and selecting the path with the largest distance to Pac-Man's current position.
The distance of a path from Pac-Man's position is defined as the minimum distance of any tile on the path from Pac-Man's
position.

Shortest paths in the maze graph can be computed with the method *Maze.findPath(Tile source, Tile target)*. 
This method runs a Breadth-First-Search on the underlying grid graph to compute the shortest path. The used
[graph library](https://github.com/armin-reichert/graph) provides also more sophisticated search algorithms
like Dijkstra or [A-Star](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html) which is called inside the Maze class:

```java
PathFinder pathfinder = new AStarPathFinder<>(grid, edge -> 1, grid::manhattan);
	// new BreadthFirstSearchPathFinder<>(grid);
pathfinder.traverseGraph(cell(source), cell(target));
```

A* certainly sounds "cooler" than BFS, but doesn't give additional value in this use-case because the maze is represented 
by a graph with uniform distance between every two adjacent vertices (neighbor tiles). 
Thus the A* or Dijkstra algorithms just degenerate to BFS (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Of course one could represent the graph differently, for example with vertices only for crossings and weighted edges 
for passages, in which case Dijkstra or A* would become useful.

## Additional features

- Display of actor states and timers can be switched on/off at runtime (key 's')
- Display of actor routes can be switched on/off at runtime (key 'r')
- Ghosts can be enabled/disabled during the game (keys 'b', 'p', 'i', 'c')

## Summary

The goal of this project is to implement a Pac-Man game in a way that also beginners 
should be able to fully understand the game's inner workings. The implementation tries to achieve this by following 
the MVC pattern and by using explicit finite state machines for the control logic of the actors and the game. 
The state machines are defined in a declarative way using the builder pattern. 
The program code tries to be as clear as possible and use good naming all over the place.

A simple, home-grown library is used for the basic game infrastructure (active rendering, game loop, full-screen mode, 
keyboard and mouse handling etc.), but it is not too difficult to write these infrastructure parts from scratch or 
use some real game library instead. 

It would also be useful to further decouple UI, model and controller to enable an easy replacement of the complete UI 
or to implement the state machines using some other state machine library.

Comments are welcome!
