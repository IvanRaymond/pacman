	 * <p>
	 * <cite>Inky is difficult to predict, because he is the only one of the ghosts
	 * that uses a factor other than Pac-Man’s position/orientation when determining
	 * his target tile. Inky actually uses both Pac-Man’s position/facing as well as
	 * Blinky’s (the red ghost’s) position in his calculation. To locate Inky’s
	 * target, we first start by selecting the position two tiles in front of
	 * Pac-Man in his current direction of travel, similar to Pinky’s targeting
	 * method. From there, imagine drawing a vector from Blinky’s position to this
	 * tile, and then doubling the length of the vector. The tile that this new,
	 * extended vector ends on will be Inky’s actual target.</cite>

	 * Clyde's chase behavior as described <a href=
	 * "http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior">here</a>.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <cite> The unique feature of Clyde’s targeting is that it has two separate
	 * modes which he constantly switches back and forth between, based on his
	 * proximity to Pac-Man. Whenever Clyde needs to determine his target tile, he
	 * first calculates his distance from Pac-Man. If he is farther than eight tiles
	 * away, his targeting is identical to Blinky’s, using Pac-Man’s current tile as
	 * his target. However, as soon as his distance to Pac-Man becomes less than
	 * eight tiles, Clyde’s target is set to the same tile as his fixed one in
	 * Scatter mode, just outside the bottom-left corner of the maze.</cite>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <cite> The combination of these two methods has the overall effect of Clyde
	 * alternating between coming directly towards Pac-Man, and then changing his
	 * mind and heading back to his corner whenever he gets too close. On the
	 * diagram above, the X marks on the path represent the points where Clyde’s
	 * mode switches. If Pac-Man somehow managed to remain stationary in that
	 * position, Clyde would indefinitely loop around that T-shaped area. As long as
	 * the player is not in the lower-left corner of the maze, Clyde can be avoided
	 * completely by simply ensuring that you do not block his “escape route” back
	 * to his corner. While Pac-Man is within eight tiles of the lower-left corner,
	 * Clyde’s path will end up in exactly the same loop as he would eventually
	 * maintain in Scatter mode. </cite>
