/**
 * Attempt at implementing the original Ghost behavior as described <a href=
 * "http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior">here</a>:
 *
 * <p>
 * The next step is understanding exactly how the ghosts attempt to reach their
 * target tiles. The ghostsâ€™ AI is very simple and short-sighted, which makes
 * the complex behavior of the ghosts even more impressive. Ghosts only ever
 * plan one step into the future as they move about the maze. <br/>
 * Whenever a ghost enters a new tile, it looks ahead to the next tile that it
 * will reach, and makes a decision about which direction it will turn when it
 * gets there. These decisions have one very important restriction, which is
 * that ghosts may never choose to reverse their direction of travel. That is, a
 * ghost cannot enter a tile from the left side and then decide to reverse
 * direction and move back to the left. The implication of this restriction is
 * that whenever a ghost enters a tile with only two exits, it will always
 * continue in the same direction. </cite>
